This was an assignment for a distributed systems class to learn
about Java RMI. Uses a Bully algorithm for leader election and
has an ElectionDriver which causes the algorithm to have to do
some more work.

ElectionNode
- The remote interface which all nodes implement

DeadNodeException
- An exception which gets thrown if the node has been instructed
  to ignore some number of elections.

Node
- The central class which does the leader election

ElectionDriver
- Makes the leader election a little more interesting by changing
  the nodes' names and having them ignore some elections.
